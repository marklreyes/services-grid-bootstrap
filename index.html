                        <h6>What is the Achilles Tendon?</h6>
                        <p>The Achilles tendon attaches at your heal and ends at your calf muscle. It is located in a place that is quite visible at the rear of your foot. It enables the foot to point and flex.</p>
                        <h6>What causes Achilles Tendonitis?</h6>
                        <p>Achilles tendonitis is an inflammation of Achilles tendon which connects the calf muscle to the heel bone. It’s common in runners and middle aged people who enjoys sports on the weekend so called “weekend warriors.” It often results from microtears that occur in the tendon during strenuous, high impact exercise, such as running. In severe cases, Achilles tendon may rupture which would require a surgical repair.</p>

                        <p>Athlete’s foot is a fungal infection of the skin, that usually develops around the toes. This fungus is attracted to moist, dark, and warm areas and thrives when feet remain unwashed or untreated. Symptoms of athlete’s foot include itching, burning, scaling, inflammation, dry skin, odor, and blisters (which can lead to cracking and exposure.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Athlete’s Foot?</h6>
                        <p>Any location that provides warmth, moisture, and skin contact can be a breeding ground for athlete’s foot. Locker rooms, community showers, pools, and yoga rooms are prime areas where athlete’s foot can spread. Athlete’s foot can spread from skin to skin contact and can easily be spread to the underarms or groin through hand contact. Additionally, the fungus that causes athlete's foot is able to survive for long periods in a dormant state and can be transmitted by skin contact with contaminated clothes, bedding or carpet.</p>

                        <h6>What Are Bunions?
                        </h6>
                        <p>Bunions are bony lumps that form on the side of the foot where the big toe joins with the foot. A bunion forms when the big toe pushes towards the other toes and the joint of the big toe gets bigger, becoming deformed. This often painful condition can be aggravated by wearing improperly fitting shoes or uncontrolled pronation issues. The joint where the toe bends when walking is also affected by a bunion and it can make walking uncomfortable. The skin and tissue that covers the joint can become swollen and red and calluses often develop on the side of the big toe where a shoe rubs against the enlarged joint.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes a Bunion?</h6>
                        <p>Bunions are caused by a variety of factors including injury, birth defects, certain types of arthritis, or an inherited foot type. Jobs that require you to stand for prolonged periods of time may also put excess pressure on your foot, causing a bunion to form. Experts disagree on whether or not footwear that is too tight or too narrow can the cause a bunion, though poorly fitting footwear can certainly aggravate the condition causing unnecessary discomfort to patients with bunions.</p>

                        <h6>What Are Corns?</h6>
                        <p>Corns are one of your body’s responses to friction or pressure on the skin of the foot. Corns usually grow on tops and sides of the foot, often at near the toe joints. Corns range from a slight thickening of skin to a painful soft or hard bump. They often form on top of buckled toe joints (hammer toes). If your toes curl under, you may develop corns on the tips of your toes. You may also get a corn on the end of a toe if it rubs continuously against your shoe. Corns can also develop between toes, often between the first and second toes. In many cases, corns and calluses look bad but are not harmful although in more severe cases, corns may become infected, destroy healthy tissue, or affect foot mobility.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Corns?</h6>
                        <p>Corns are often caused by pronation issues although incorrectly fitting footwear is the most common culprit. High heeled shoes put pressure on the toes and shift all of a person’s weight forward, affecting the movement of the foot and the stride.</p>

                        <h6>What Are Flat Feet?</h6>
                        <p>Flat feet are the result of a reduced or undetectable arch in the inner foot. This arch is noticeable while standing in most adults. It supports the foot and allows muscles to align properly for optimum movement. In those with no arches in their feet, the foot tends to roll in causing the feet to point outward.</p>
                        <p>While most people with low arches do not have any problems, straining of the muscles meant to be aligned while the feel are pointing forward can cause pain and stress on the knees, ankles, and feet. Additionally, the outward point of the feet is commonly known as duck feet and is quite noticeable to others.</p>
                        <h6>What are the causes of flat feet?</h6>
                        <p>Genetic heritage is a common factor in fallen arches, especially if it is noticeable in children. Weakness in arches can be a cause. This is especially noticeable if there is an adequate arch while someone is sitting, but this disappears whenever that person stands up. Injury or ruptured tendon can cause fallen arches as well as arthritis if it is advanced enough. Pregnancy can cause this condition as women typically gain weight while carrying a child. Diseases such as spina bifida, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy can cause symptoms in the foot. In childhood, the foot can grow in such a way that stiffness and flat feet develop even with no family history. Diabetes can be blamed to fallen arches, especially when left untreated. Finally, age and usage can be causes of fallen arches. In athletes who participate in a sport long term, the muscles of the foot can atrophy due to repetitive use. If this overuse causes some of the tendons in the foot or calf to tear or weaken, arches may suffer from the imbalance.</p>

                        <h6>What Are Fractures?</h6>
                        <p>Ankle fractures and injuries are common and pain caused by these conditions often lead the injured to seek medical care in an emergency situation.When it comes to ankle fractures your podiatrists share the same concern. Diagnosing a fracture can only be done through an X-ray. This can be done by a foot and ankle doctor in Wyandotte and Southfield.</p>
                        <p>The ankle joint consists of three bones:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The tibia the major bone of the lower leg. The tibia makes up the medial of the ankle joint.</li>
                            <li>The fibula, a much smaller bone that makes up the outside part or the lateral of the ankle joint and lies parallel to the tibia in the lower leg.</li>
                            <li>The third bone, the malleoli (singular malleolus) resides at the far end of the fibula and the tibia. These three bones unite to form an arch that sits on the superior aspect of the talus, a bone in your foot. It is pertinent to know the structure of the ankle in explaining ankle fractures.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The ankle joint is made up of these three bones and the entire joint structure is surrounded by a joint capsule. The capsule is a fibrous structure which contains a fluid known as synovial fluid. Synovial fluid is produced by the synovium and provides lubrication for movement across joint surfaces. The ankle joint is also held in place by many ligaments. These ligaments are fibers that stabilize and maintain the position of the bones.</p>
                        <h6>What are the causes of Foot and Ankle Fractures?</h6>
                        <p>Ankle fracture occur when the ankle joint is stressed beyond its limits, causing the different elements of the joint to fail.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If stress causes wear and tear of the ligaments only, the result is a sprain.</li>
                            <li>However, a fracture occurs when the ankle bone breaks. It is important to note that fractures can happen with simultaneous tears of the ligaments. This can happen:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If the ankle rolls in or out.</li>
                                    <li>If the ankle twists from side to side.</li>
                                    <li>When extending or flexing the joint.</li>
                                    <li>When applying extreme force to the joint.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6>How do I know that my Foot or Ankle is Fractured?</h6>
                        <p>Indications of foot and ankle fractures are fairly obvious. The major symptom is pain. In most cases pain is “referred” meaning it does not come from the exact point of fracture. There may also be associated fractures especially in the knee or on the side of the small toe. When severe, pain from a foot and ankle fracture may deter a patient from walking.</p>
                        <p>Another symptom of a fracture is swelling around the ankle. Swelling may mean two things – damage to the soft tissue with possible blood around the joint or the presence of fluid within the joint (in many cases, blood). Blood in the joints is known as hemarthrosis.</p>
                        <p>There may also be bruising around the joint that may not occur immediately. Bruising may course towards the toes or the sole of the foot. In extreme cases, the bones around the ankle may also be deformed. Skin may stretch over underlying fractured bone or bone itself may be visible.</p>
                        <p>Pain may become more severe if injury occurs to the blood vessels and nerves of the foot. If numbness sets in you may be unable to move your toes or feet.</p>

                        <h6>What Are Hammer Toes?</h6>
                        <p>A hammertoe is a condition where a toe bends downward instead of forward. It can affect any toe, although it most often affects the second or third toes. This condition ranges in severity with some cases resulting in rigidity where the toe can’t be moved or flexed and other patients still having some mobility in the toe joints. The hammer toe is often exposed to increased rubbing and friction which causes calluses and irritation of the skin. Hammer-toes are sometimes present at birth although they typically develop later in age due to wearing poorly fitting shoes or arthritis.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Hammer Toes?</h6>
                        <p>Hammer toes form when the muscles responsible for toe movement become imbalanced and pull the delicate bones of the feet out of alignment. This imbalance and misalignment puts a great deal of pressure on the joints and tendons, pushing the toe into the hammerhead shape. The excessive pressure on the joint is responsible for the pain associated with the condition. There are three common causes for the imbalance including arthritis, injuries, and genetics.</p>

                        <h6>What is Heel Pain?</h6>
                        <p>Plantar fasciitis is a common foot problem and the clinical name for heel pain. When pain is behind the heel, the condition is known as Achilles tendinitis. Pain can also affect the outer or inner side of the foot and heel.</p>
                        <p>In many cases, pain is not caused by wound or injury but begins in a mild form, and then becomes severe. In extreme cases, pain may even disable the patient. Plantar fasciitis may resolve without treatment, but can also be persistent and chronic.</p>
                        <p>Major causes of plantar fasciitis include infection, arthritis, neurological disorder, or trauma.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Heel Pain?</h6>
                        <p>There are many causes of heel pain. Plantar fasciitis is not necessarily caused by one injury, but from persistent pounding and stress on the heel. Some major causes of plantar fasciitis include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Inflammation of the plantar fascia:</strong> Plantar fascia is a ligament that connects the heel bone to the tip of the foot. It is quite strong and looks like a bowstring. The plantar fascia becomes inflamed when it is stretched beyond its limits. Inflammation usually happens at the point of attachment to the heel bone. Though in some cases, it may affect the middle part of the foot. Pain often occurs under the foot, especially after resting for a prolonged period. Cramps of the calf muscle may occur if the Achilles tendon becomes tightened.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heel bursitis</strong> is an inflammation of the bursa, a fibrous sac at the back of the heel filled with fluid. Heel bursitis happens when landing awkwardly on the foot. Pain is felt at the back of the heel, or in some cases, inside the heel. The Achilles tendon may swell. Pain caused by heel bursitis is chronic.</p>
                        <p><strong>Heel bumps</strong> also referred to as <strong>pump bumps</strong> occur mostly in teenagers. The heel bone of teenagers are not fully mature. If rubbed frequently it can result in excess formation of bone. Mostly occurring in persons with flat feet, heel bumps also occur when teens wear high heeled shoes before the bone is fully mature.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tarsal tunnel syndrome</strong> occurs when nerve fibers in the back of the foot becomes entrapped or pinched.</p>
                        <p><strong>Inflamed heel pad:</strong> Inflammation of the heel pad happens when the pad is excessively thin. Heavy footsteps may inflame heel pad.</p>
                        <p><strong>Stress fractures</strong> are caused by strenuous exercise, injury or heavy laborious work. Athletes are most prone to stress fracture. May also be caused by osteoporosis.</p>
                        <p><strong>Severs disease</strong> is very common in children and teenage athletes. Caused by excessive use or trauma in the growth plates of the heel bone. Children between the ages of 7 and 15 are most commonly affected.</p>
                        <p><strong>Achilles tendinosis</strong> known clinically as <strong>degenerative tendinopathy</strong>. It is caused by the gradual degeneration of the Achilles tendon.</p>
                        <p>Heel pain may also be caused by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rupture of the Achilles tendon.</li>
                            <li>A tear to the plantar fascia.</li>
                            <li>Baxter's nerve entrapment.</li>
                            <li>Calcaneal cysts.</li>
                            <li>A tear of the short flexor tendon.</li>
                            <li>Systemic arthritis.</li>
                            <li>Bruise to the bone.</li>
                            <li>Poor blood circulation.</li>
                            <li>Poor posture while walking or running.</li>

                        <h6>What Is a Heel Spur?</h6>
                        <p>A heel spur is a bony growth near the heel bone. It causes discomfort in the foot centered around the heel bone. It is often quite painful in the morning or at any time where pressure is changed such as going from sitting to standing or spending long times on your feet. When the muscles surrounding your heel are strained, the membrane surrounding the muscle is torn away and tissue is exposed to additional pressure. These symptoms do not heal if no changes are made to lifestyle or exercise habits.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Heel Spurs?</h6>
                        <p>Heel spurs are caused by a variety of factors. Excessive running or jogging while on hard surfaces such as concrete can injure the foot and cause tightness in the calf. Irregularities in walking gait can put additional stress on the muscles around the heel. Bad shoes or shoes that are not the correct size can cause issues. Finally, obesity can put undue pressure on the heel and cause injury. The excessive pressure or repeated force can cause the calcium deposits to build up in response to injury.</p>

                        <h6>What Is an Ingrown Toenail?</h6>
                        <p>Ingrown toenails are nails that grow into the skin instead of on top of it. While they can occur on any toe, they most frequently occur on the big toe. Ingrown toenails are typically very painful, with pain increasing when wearing shoes, walking, or otherwise placing pressure on the foot and the toes.</p>
                        <p>Ingrown toenails turn inward toward the side of the nail bed and put pressure on the skin, causing pain and sometimes infection. Ingrown nails often develop as a result of ill-fitting shoes or when toenails are trimmed into a curved shape instead of being trimmed straight across.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Ingrown Toenails?</h6>
                        <p>Incorrect nail trimming is one of the most common causes of ingrown toenails. You should always cut your toenails straight across and not curved to the shape of the toe. The straight across cut prevents the edges of the nail from burrowing into the skin. Other common causes of ingrown toenails include wearing poorly fitting shoes, especially those that squeeze the toes, like pointy shoes. Patients with thick nails or nails that tend to curve inward have a higher risk of developing ingrown toenails. If left untreated, the area around the nail can become infected, resulting in pain and inflammation</p>

                        <h6>What is a neuroma?</h6>
                        <p>A neuroma is a thickening of the tissue around a nerve that is typically located in the ball of the foot. Symptoms are usually aggravated while walking or standing on the ball of the foot for long periods of time (like when wearing high heels). Patients often feel the sensation of a “pebble” or “rock” under their foot as the inflamed tissue can become so large that it can be felt under the skin.</p>
                        <h6>What causes a neuroma?</h6>
                        <p>Anything that causes compression or irritation of the nerve can lead to the development of a neuroma. One of the most common offenders is wearing shoes that have a tapered toe box, or high-heeled shoes that cause the toes to be forced into the toe box.</p>
                        <p>People with certain foot deformities – bunions, hammertoes, flatfeet, or more flexible feet – are at higher risk for developing a neuroma. Other potential causes are activities that involve repetitive irritation to the ball of the foot, such as running or court sports. An injury or other type of trauma to the area may also lead to a neuroma.</p>

                        <p>Plantar fasciitis occurs when the plantar fascia, a strong band of connective tissue that runs from the bottom of the foot to the heel becomes inflamed and aggravated. Pain is usually felt in the heel and along the bottom of the foot. Pain from plantar fasciitis is typically worse in the morning and following periods of inactivity. The discomfort and stiffness fades throughout the day as the foot is used, however the pain returns after another round of inactivity. Plantar fasciitis can be addressed with gentle stretching exercises and massage to relieve swelling and increase flexibility and strength in the tendon itself. In some instances, injections of anti-inflammatory or corticosteroid medications into the heel prescribed when stretching and massage do not provide relief.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Plantar Fasciitis?</h6>
                        <p>Plantar Fasciitis is typically caused by overuse of the feet and a tightening in the Achilles’ tendon. When the Achilles’ tendon becomes tight, it pulls on the fascia of the foot. This tightness is responsible for the stabbing pain many people experience first thing in the morning. Some contributing factors include being overweight or obese, which puts additional strain on the feet. Long distance runners often experience problems with their plantar fascia from the repeated impact and strain of running. Also, those who work in physically demanding professions, who spend many hours on their feet each day are more likely to experience plantar fasciitis.</p>

                        <p>Sports injuries are very common. When athletes of any level train or compete in sports they put significant pressure and strain on their muscles, bones, and joints. Sports injuries often affect the foot and ankle as these body parts bear most of the strain in sporting and athletic activities ranging from jogging to skiing. Several injuries can be prevented or reduced when athletes follow the recommendations of the podiatrist. Some of the most common sports injuries include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Achilles bursitis</li>

                        <p>If you are experiencing any of the following issues or symptoms you should make an appointment to see one of the doctors at the Foot & Ankle Specialists of New Jersey for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Severe swelling</li>
                            <li>Great discomfort, especially when walking</li>
                            <li>Unable to perform typical everyday tasks after 3 days</li>
                            <li>Sensations of pins and needles or loss of feeling in the foot or ankle</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If you have used the RICE therapy of rest, ice, compression, and elevation to treat your injury at home without significant results and are either unable to walk after 3 days or the pain is not decreasing, you should see a make an appointment for professional medical assessment.</p>

                        <h6>What are Plantar Warts?</h6>
                        <p>Plantar warts are small growths that usually appear on the weight-bearing surfaces of your feet. They are caused by HPV (Human papillomavirus) which feeds off of tiny blood vessels in your feet. Plantar warts are usually flat lesions with a rough surface.  At the center of the wart, tiny black dots serve as the blood supply to the wart itself.  These warts can make it painful for anyone to walk on their feet. The warts are also contagious and should be treated upon discovery.</p>
                        <h6>How Are Warts Spread?</h6>
                        <p>Warts usually spread through indirect contact. For example, if a person with a wart touches or uses something, like a communal shower at a swimming pool or gym, without wearing shoes or covering the wart and then another person uses or touches the same surface, the second person can contract the virus. However, in most cases, the person contracting the wart virus will typically have a compromised immune system, leaving him or her vulnerable to infections and viruses. It is easier to contract the wart virus after being sick and it is relatively common to get one after suffering a cold or the flu.</p>

                        <h6>What Are Common Wounds on the Feet and Ankles?</h6>
                        <p>While everyone cuts or scrapes a foot every now and then, patients with diabetes or other immune disorders are susceptible to foot ulcers. When an open sore develops on the bottom of the foot, this can often lead or hospitalization if left untreated. The most common factor for a foot ulcer is diabetes. Complications related to diabetes such as heart disease, eye disorders, and kidney malfunction are directly correlated to an increase in foot ulcers. If left untreated, foot ulcers can cause significant discomfort, infection, and lead to amputation. Up to 25% of patients with a foot ulcer require amputation and it is the leading cause of non-traumatic amputations in the United States.</p>
                        <h6>What Causes Foot Ulcers?</h6>
                        <p>Anyone diagnosed with diabetes is at an increased risk for foot ulcers. This is additionally magnified in older men, Native Americans, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. Also, factors such as obesity, use of tobacco, and excessive use of alcohol can contribute to the development of these ulcers. Typically, a combination of poor circulation, friction, trauma, duration of symptoms, and neuropathy or the lack of feeling in feet can cause distress in the foot and foot ulcers. Additionally, vascular disease and a compromised immune system can reduce healing time and cause an increased risk for complications.</p>
